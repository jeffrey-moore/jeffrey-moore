- 👋 Hi, I’m @jeffrey-moore
- 👀 I’m interested in learning as much about coding and software as possible (potential career change?).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning as much as I can about anything and everything.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project you might need someone who doesn't know what they're doing.
- 📫 How to reach me...have you tried using your arms?
